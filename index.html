              /><strong>J.R.R. Tolkien</strong>, in full John Ronald Reuel
              Tolkien, (born January 3, 1892, Bloemfontein, South Africa—died
              September 2, 1973, Bournemouth, Hampshire, England),<em>
                english writer and scholar
              </em>
              who achieved fame with his children’s book The Hobbit (1937) and
              his richly inventive epic fantasy The Lord of the Rings (1954–55).
            </p>
            <p>
              At age four Tolkien, with his mother and younger brother, settled
              near Birmingham, England, after his father, a bank manager, died
              in South Africa. In 1900 his mother converted to Roman
              Catholicism, a faith her elder son also practiced devoutly. On her
              death in 1904, her boys became wards of a Catholic priest. Four
              years later Tolkien fell in love with another orphan, Edith
              Bratt,<em>
                who would inspire his fictional character Lúthien Tinúviel</em
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              His guardian, however, disapproved, and not until his 21st
              birthday could Tolkien ask Edith to marry him. In the meantime, he
              attended King Edward’s School in Birmingham and Exeter College,
              Oxford (B.A., 1915; M.A., 1919).<strong>
                During World War I
              </strong>
              he saw action in the Somme. After the Armistice he was briefly on
              the staff of The Oxford English Dictionary (then called The New
              English Dictionary).
            </p>
            <p>
              For most of his adult life, he taught English language and
              literature, specializing <em>in Old and Middle English </em>, at
              the Universities of Leeds (1920–25) and Oxford (1925–59). Often
              busy with academic duties and also acting as an examiner for other
              universities, he produced few but influential scholarly
              publications, notably a standard edition of Sir Gawain and the
              Green Knight (1925; with E.V. Gordon) and a landmark lecture on
              Beowulf (Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics, 1936).
            </p>
            <p>
              Tolkien had completed a translation of <strong>Beowulf</strong> in
              1926, and it was posthumously published, along with classroom
              lectures he had given on the subject, some of his notes, and an
              original short story inspired by the legend, as Beowulf: A
              Translation and Commentary (2014). He also published an edition of
              the Ancrene Wisse (1962).
            </p>
            <p>
              In private, Tolkien amused himself by writing an elaborate series
              of fantasy tales, often dark and sorrowful, set in a world of his
              own creation. He made this “legendarium,” which eventually became
              The Silmarillion, partly to provide a setting in which “Elvish”
              languages he had invented could exist. But
              <strong>his tales of Arda and Middle-earth</strong> also grew from
              a desire to tell stories, influenced by a love of myths and
              legends. To entertain his four children, he devised lighter fare,
              lively and often humorous.

              The longest and most important of those stories, begun about 1930,
              was The Hobbit, a coming-of-age fantasy about a comfort-loving
              “hobbit” (a smaller relative of Man) who joins a quest for a
              dragon’s treasure. In 1937 The Hobbit was published, with pictures
              by the author (an accomplished amateur artist), and was so popular
              that its publisher asked for a sequel.<em>
                The result, 17 years later, was Tolkien’s masterpiece</em
              >, The Lord of the Rings, a modern version of the heroic epic. A
              few elements from The Hobbit were carried over, in particular a
              magic ring, now revealed to be the One Ring, which must be
              destroyed before it can be used by the terrible Dark Lord, Sauron,
              to rule the world. But The Lord of the Rings is also an extension
              of Tolkien’s Silmarillion tales, which gave the new book a
              “history” in which<strong> Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and Men </strong>
              were already established.
            </p>
            <p>
              Contrary to statements often made by critics, The Lord of the
              Rings was not written specifically for children, nor is it a
              trilogy, though it is often published in three parts: The
              Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the
              King. It was divided originally because of its bulk and to reduce
              the risk to its publisher should it fail to sell. In fact it
              proved immensely popular. On its publication in paperback in the
              United States in 1965, it attained cult status on college
              campuses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although some critics disparage it, several polls since 1996 have
              named The Lord of the Rings the best book of the 20th century, and
              its success made it possible for other authors to thrive by
              writing fantasy fiction. It had sold more than 50 million copies
              in some 30 languages by the turn of the 21st century.
              <strong>A film version</strong> of The Lord of the Rings by New
              Zealand director Peter Jackson, released in three installments in
              2001–03, achieved worldwide critical and financial success.
              Jackson then adapted The Hobbit as a trilogy comprising the films
              An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and
              The Battle of the Five Armies (2014). In 2004 the text of The Lord
              of the Rings was carefully corrected for a 50th-anniversary
              edition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Subsequent study of his father’s papers led Christopher to produce
              <em>Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth (1980)</em>; The
              History of Middle-earth, 12 vol. (1983–96), which traces the
              writing of the legendarium, including The Lord of the Rings,
              through its various stages; and The Children of Húrin (Narn I Chin
              Hurin: The Tale of the Children of Hurin), published in 2007, one
              of the three “Great Tales” of The Silmarillion in longer form.
            </p>
            <p>
              Christopher also edited Beren and Lúthien (2017), which centres on
              the romance between a man and an elf and was inspired by Tolkien’s
              relationship with his wife; the book contains various retellings
              of the story, including the original version that was written in
              1917.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among other posthumous works by Tolkien are The Father Christmas
              Letters (1976; also published as Letters from Father Christmas),
              The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien (1981), the children’s stories Mr.
              Bliss (1982) and Roverandom (1998), and The Legend of Sigurd and
              Gudrún (2009), two narrative poems drawn from northern legend and
              written in the style of the Poetic Edda.<strong>
                The Fall of Arthur (2013)</strong

              was an unfinished verse exploration of Arthurian legend inspired

            Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who wanted to be left alone in quiet

            dwarves. Soon Bilbo was drawn into their quest, facing evil orcs,
            savage wolves, giant spiders, and worse unknown dangers. Finally, it
            was Bilbo -- alone and unaided -- who had to confront the great

            This three volume novel is an epic high fantasy novel. The story
            began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's fantasy novel The
            Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was
            written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during World War
            II.

            the tragedy mounts to its end in the murder of Sigurd at the hands

          <p>
            The story of the creation of the world and of the First Age, this is
            the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings
            look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and
            Galadriel, took part. The three Silmarils were jewels created by
            Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the
            Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were
            destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied
            Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were
            seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the
            impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The
            Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his
            kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to
            Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism,
            against the great Enemy.
