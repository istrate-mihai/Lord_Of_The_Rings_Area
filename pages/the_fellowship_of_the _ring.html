			<article class="mainsectionarticle">
				<p><img src="../images/the_fellowship.jpg" alt="Book Cover" title="Book Cover" id="Book_Cover1">The first sets the stage for the adventure and follows<strong> Frodo Baggins</strong> as he flees from his home in the Shire to escape the minions of the <strong>Dark Lord Sauron</strong>. Sauron seeks the One Ring that will allow him to control the Bearers of the nineteen other Rings and control the three major races of Middle-earth: Elves, Men, and Dwarves. The One Ring has been inherited by Frodo who finds himself unwittingly in the midst of a struggle for world domination.</p>
	
	<p>The first chapter in the book begins quite lightly, following on from The Hobbit which is more of a whimsical children's story than The Lord of the Rings. It begins with Bilbo celebrating his 111th (or eleventy first, as it is called) birthday, on the same day that Frodo celebrates his 33rd birthday (his 'coming of age'). At the birthday party, Bilbo disappears after his speech, to the surprise of all.<em> Frodo </em> later learns about the ring which he had used to make himself invisible, and also about some of its darker powers.</p>
	
	<p>Heeding the advice of the wizard<strong> Gandalf </strong>, Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him. He hopes to reach Rivendell, where he will be safe from Sauron, and where those wiser than he can decide what to do about the Ring.</p>
	
	<p>In his journey he is accompanied by three hobbit friends, Peregrin Took, Meriadoc Brandybuck and <strong> Samwise Gamgee </strong>, often refered to as Merry, Pippin and Sam. From the start they are pursued by Black Riders, the Ringwraiths who serve Sauron. Narrowly escaping these and other dangers and meeting other interesting characters en route (e.g., Tom Bombadil) they eventually come to Bree, where they meet Strider, another friend of Gandalf who leads them the rest of the way to Rivendell, through further hardships.</p>
	
	
	<p>Frodo is stabbed upon the mountain of Weathertop by the chief of the Nazgûl with a Morgul-knife - as part of the knife stays inside him, he gets sicker on the rest of the journey. They also pass the trolls which had been turned to stone in the previous book, The Hobbit.</p>
	
	<h3>Chapters:</h3>

	<dl>
	 <dt>I: A Long-expected Party:</dt>	
	 <dd>Details Bilbo and Frodo's Birthday Party, chapter ends with Bilbo leaving the Shire.</dd>
	<dt>II: The Shadow of the Past:</dt>
	<dd>Gandalf tells Frodo the true nature of the ring, and how it must be taken to Mordor and destroyed. Sam, who has been listening at the window, is told to accompany Frodo. </dd>
	<dt>III: Three is Company:</dt>
	<dd>Frodo sells Bag End, and officially is going to move to a house at Crickhollow in the area beyond Bucklebury in Buckland; he actually plans to disappear without causing too much of a fuss. Frodo, Sam and Pippin set out through the South Farthing of the Shire towards Buckland, and encounter a black rider. They also meet Gildor the wood elf, with other wood elves.</dd>
		<dt>IV: A Short Cut to Mushrooms:</dt>
	<dd>They meet Farmer Maggot while taking a short cut, and he gives them some of his prized mushrooms. Merry joins them at the end.</dd>
		<dt>V: A Conspiracy Unmasked:</dt>
	<dd>Takes place at Frodo's new house at Crickhollow. The title refers to Frodo about to tell Merry and Pippin about his quest, who he had previously believed not to know about it, and they tell him that they had known much of it all along. They also meet Fatty Bolger. Frodo decides to leave the next day through the Old Forest, as it is an unexpected direction, rather than travelling on the roads.</dd>
		<dt>VI: The Old Forest:</dt>
	<dd>Although trying to avoid it, the hobbits get lost and travel to the River Withywindle, the "queerest part of the whole wood". Merry and Pippin are trapped inside Old Man Willow, and are freed only when Tom Bombadil arrives.</dd>
		<dt>VII: In the House of Tom Bombadil:</dt>
	<dd>Tom knows much about the hobbits, and even tries on the Ring, yet it does not have any effect on him - it doesn't even make him invisible. Frodo tries on the ring then to see if it 'works', and Tom Bombadil is also able to see Frodo while he has the ring on.</dd>
		<dt>VIII: Fog on the Barrow-downs:</dt>
	<dd>Travelling through the Barrow-downs, the hobbits are imprisoned by Barrow-wights, where they are rescued again by Tom Bombadil. The hobbits are given daggers from the treasure in one of the downs.</dd>
		<dt>IX: At the Sign of the Prancing Pony:</dt>
	<dd>The hobbits reach the The Prancing Pony inn at Bree, where Frodo uses a false name, Underhill. Later, after singing a song on a table, he trips and accidentally puts the ring on his finger, disappearing, which causes a commotion.</dd>
		<dt>X: Strider:</dt>
	<dd>Strider, who had at first seemed menacing, turns out to be friendly. The innkeeper, Butterbur, gives Frodo a late letter from Gandalf, which tells him that Strider is a friend of Gandalf's whose real name is Aragorn.</dd>
		<dt>XI: A Knife in the Dark:</dt>
	<dd> The hobbits set out from Bree with Strider on foot after their horses had bolted when Black Riders arrived at the inn at night. The Riders had attacked the beds which they were supposed to be staying in, though in vain as Strider had them stay in another room. They buy a pony from Bill Ferny. They pass through the Midgewater Marshes, and reach Weathertop. There they are attacked by five Black Riders; Frodo puts on the ring to escape them, and is stabbed in the shoulder by the Witch-king of Angmar, leader of the nine Ringwraiths (Nazgul).</dd>
		<dt>XII: Flight to the Ford:</dt>
	<dd> They pass the trolls Bert, Tom and William, which were turned to stone by Gandalf in The Hobbit. Eventually, they meet the elf Glorfindel from Rivendell, who allows Frodo to take his white horse to escape the Ringwraiths on their way to Rivendell. The Black Riders are washed away in a flood over the Ford.</dd>

			<article class="mainsectionarticle">
					<img id="Fellowship" src="../images/the_fellowship_members_artwork.jpg" alt="Fellowship Members" title="Fellowship Members">
					
			<p>Book II chronicles Frodo's stay at Rivendell, where a plan is hatched at the Council of Elrond to destroy the Ring in Mordor. Early on Frodo meets his uncle Bilbo, whom he had not seen since he left Hobbiton much earlier. Frodo sets forth from Rivendell with nine companions:<em> two Men, Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of the land of Gondor; an Elven prince, Legolas; Frodo's old friend and powerful wizard, Gandalf; Gimli the Dwarf; and Frodo's original three hobbit companions</em>.</p>
	
	<p><strong>These Nine Walkers</strong> were chosen to represent the free races of Middle-earth and as a balance to the Nine Riders. They were also accompanied by Bill the Pony, whom Strider and the Hobbits acquired in Bree as a pack horse. Their attempt to cross the Misty Mountains is foiled by heavy snow, so they are forced to take a path under the mountains via Moria, an ancient Dwarf kingdom, now full of Orcs and other evil creatures, such as the Watcher in the Water guarding the south gate. Just before escaping Moria, Gandalf falls into the abyss while battling a Balrog.</p>
	
	<p><em>The remaining eight members of the Fellowship</em> then spend some time in the elf-haven of Lothlórien, where they receive gifts from the Elf-queen Galadriel that in many cases prove useful later in the quest. They leave Lórien by river, but Frodo begins to realize the Ring is having a malevolent effect on some members of the party, especially Boromir, who tries to take the ring from Frodo. In the process, Frodo puts on the ring to escape him. Later Boromir is attacked by orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. This book ends when Frodo and Sam depart secretly for Mordor and the Fellowship of the Ring dissolves.</p>

		<h3><i class="fas fa-sun"></i> Lore:</h3>
		
		<article class="sidebararticle"> 
			
			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Elves</h4>
			
			<p>The Elves, who called themselves the Quendi, and who in lore are commonly referred to as the Eldar (adj. Eldarin), were the first and eldest of the Children of Ilúvatar, and are considered to be the fairest and wisest of any race of Arda given sapience.

Some, known afterwards as the Calaquendi (Elves of the Light), were brought by the Valar from Middle-earth to Valinor across the Sea, where they were taught by the Ainur. But after the Silmarils were stolen by Melkor, some of the Elves returned to Middle-earth, where they remained until the end of the Third Age.

Elves were not subject to age, and were immune to illness. They could be killed only in violence or by extreme despair. </p>

			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Orcs</h4>
			
            <p> 	
				Orcs were the primary foot soldiers of the Dark Lords' armies and sometimes the weakest (but most numerous) of their servants. They were created by the first Dark Lord, Morgoth, before the First Age and served him and later his successor in their quest to dominate Middle-earth. Before Oromë first found the Elves at Cuiviénen, Melkor kidnapped some of them and cruelly tortured them, twisting them into the first Orcs. </p>

		<article class="sidebararticle">
			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Dwarves</h4>
					    <p>Dwarves were a race of Middle-earth also known as the Khazad (in their own tongue) or Casari, Naugrim, meaning 'Stunted People', and Gonnhirrim, the 'Masters of Stone'. </p>
			<p>The Dwarves were made by Aulë, whom they themselves called Mahal, meaning “maker.” Aulë was unwilling to wait for the coming of the Children of Ilúvatar, for he was impatient and desired to have someone to teach his lore and crafts. Therefore, he made the first Seven Fathers of the Dwarves in secret in a hall under the mountains of Middle-earth. </p>
			<img src="../images/dwarves_mining.jpg" class="sidebar_image" title="Dwarves Mining" alt="Dwarves Mining">

			<p>It was, however, not within Aulë's power to create life. After being reprimanded by Ilúvatar and realizing his error, Aulë offered his creations to his father to do with as he would, including their destruction. Even as the offer was made, Ilúvatar accepted and gave the Dwarves a life of their own. So when Aulë picked up a great hammer to smite the Seven Fathers and destroy his presumptuous creations, they shrank back in fear and begged for mercy. </p>
			<p>Ilúvatar was however not willing to suffer that the Dwarves should come before the Firstborn (Elves), and he decreed that the Seven Fathers should sleep underground and should not come forth until the Firstborn had awakened.</p>

		<article class="sidebararticle">
			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Men</h4>
            <p>Men (initially named Atani) were one of several races inhabiting Arda. They are the humans of Middle-earth, and the second of the Children of Ilúvatar. </p> 
			<p>he race of Men was the second significant race of beings created by the supreme God, Ilúvatar, since they awoke at the start of the First Age, at the first rising of the Sun (FA 1), while the elves awoke three Ages before them. They were called the "Afterborn" (Quenya Atani, Sindarin: Edain) by the Elves. </p>
			<p>Men bear the Gift of Men, which is mortality, and therefore they age and die when their time comes, and are susceptible to illness and disease. Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not susceptible to aging and disease. Even if their bodies are slain, their spirits will remain bound to the world for as long as it lasts, and pass to the Halls of Mandos to wait until they are released or the world ends. </p>
			<img src="../images/humans.jpg" class="sidebar_image" title="Humans" alt="Humans">
			<p><strong>Gondor</strong> was the most prominent kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by Rohan to the north, Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea to the west, and Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath, moved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640. The city of Minas Tirith remained the capital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into years of the Fourth Age; other major fortresses included Dol Amroth in Belfalas and Osgiliath, which was a city on the Anduin. </p>
			<p>Gondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion, exiles from Númenor. Gondor was an allied kingdom with Arnor, whose line of king chieftains came from Isildur, while the Line of the Kings of Gondor was from Anárion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early years due to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed. However, continued attacks by allies of Sauron, civil war, and a devastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the Third Age until Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn II Elessar. Following that time the power of Gondor once again expanded, until the former lands of Arnor were brought under the banner of the Reunited Kingdom.  </p>
