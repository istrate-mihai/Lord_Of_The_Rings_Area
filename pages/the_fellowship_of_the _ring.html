                Frodo Baggins</strong
              >
              as he flees from his home in the Shire to escape the minions of
              the <strong>Dark Lord Sauron</strong>. Sauron seeks the One Ring
              that will allow him to control the Bearers of the nineteen other
              Rings and control the three major races of Middle-earth: Elves,
              Men, and Dwarves. The One Ring has been inherited by Frodo who
              finds himself unwittingly in the midst of a struggle for world
              domination.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first chapter in the book begins quite lightly, following on
              from The Hobbit which is more of a whimsical children's story than
              The Lord of the Rings. It begins with Bilbo celebrating his 111th
              (or eleventy first, as it is called) birthday, on the same day
              that Frodo celebrates his 33rd birthday (his 'coming of age'). At
              the birthday party, Bilbo disappears after his speech, to the
              surprise of all.<em> Frodo </em> later learns about the ring which
              he had used to make himself invisible, and also about some of its
              darker powers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Heeding the advice of the wizard<strong> Gandalf </strong>, Frodo
              leaves his home, taking the Ring with him. He hopes to reach
              Rivendell, where he will be safe from Sauron, and where those
              wiser than he can decide what to do about the Ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his journey he is accompanied by three hobbit friends, Peregrin
              Took, Meriadoc Brandybuck and <strong> Samwise Gamgee </strong>,
              often refered to as Merry, Pippin and Sam. From the start they are
              pursued by Black Riders, the Ringwraiths who serve Sauron.
              Narrowly escaping these and other dangers and meeting other
              interesting characters en route (e.g., Tom Bombadil) they
              eventually come to Bree, where they meet Strider, another friend
              of Gandalf who leads them the rest of the way to Rivendell,
              through further hardships.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frodo is stabbed upon the mountain of Weathertop by the chief of
              the Nazg√ªl with a Morgul-knife - as part of the knife stays inside
              him, he gets sicker on the rest of the journey. They also pass the
              trolls which had been turned to stone in the previous book, The
              Hobbit.

                Gandalf tells Frodo the true nature of the ring, and how it must
                be taken to Mordor and destroyed. Sam, who has been listening at
                the window, is told to accompany Frodo.
              </dd>
              <dt>III: Three is Company:</dt>
              <dd>
                Frodo sells Bag End, and officially is going to move to a house
                at Crickhollow in the area beyond Bucklebury in Buckland; he
                actually plans to disappear without causing too much of a fuss.
                Frodo, Sam and Pippin set out through the South Farthing of the
                Shire towards Buckland, and encounter a black rider. They also
                meet Gildor the wood elf, with other wood elves.
              </dd>
              <dt>IV: A Short Cut to Mushrooms:</dt>
              <dd>
                They meet Farmer Maggot while taking a short cut, and he gives

              </dd>
              <dt>V: A Conspiracy Unmasked:</dt>
              <dd>
                Takes place at Frodo's new house at Crickhollow. The title
                refers to Frodo about to tell Merry and Pippin about his quest,
                who he had previously believed not to know about it, and they
                tell him that they had known much of it all along. They also
                meet Fatty Bolger. Frodo decides to leave the next day through
                the Old Forest, as it is an unexpected direction, rather than
                travelling on the roads.
              </dd>
              <dt>VI: The Old Forest:</dt>
              <dd>
                Although trying to avoid it, the hobbits get lost and travel to
                the River Withywindle, the "queerest part of the whole wood".
                Merry and Pippin are trapped inside Old Man Willow, and are
                freed only when Tom Bombadil arrives.

              <dd>
                Tom knows much about the hobbits, and even tries on the Ring,
                yet it does not have any effect on him - it doesn't even make
                him invisible. Frodo tries on the ring then to see if it
                'works', and Tom Bombadil is also able to see Frodo while he has
                the ring on.
              </dd>
              <dt>VIII: Fog on the Barrow-downs:</dt>
              <dd>
                Travelling through the Barrow-downs, the hobbits are imprisoned
                by Barrow-wights, where they are rescued again by Tom Bombadil.
                The hobbits are given daggers from the treasure in one of the
                downs.
              </dd>
              <dt>IX: At the Sign of the Prancing Pony:</dt>
              <dd>
                The hobbits reach the The Prancing Pony inn at Bree, where Frodo
                uses a false name, Underhill. Later, after singing a song on a
                table, he trips and accidentally puts the ring on his finger,
                disappearing, which causes a commotion.
              </dd>
              <dt>X: Strider:</dt>
              <dd>
                Strider, who had at first seemed menacing, turns out to be
                friendly. The innkeeper, Butterbur, gives Frodo a late letter
                from Gandalf, which tells him that Strider is a friend of
                Gandalf's whose real name is Aragorn.
              </dd>
              <dt>XI: A Knife in the Dark:</dt>
              <dd>
                The hobbits set out from Bree with Strider on foot after their
                horses had bolted when Black Riders arrived at the inn at night.
                The Riders had attacked the beds which they were supposed to be
                staying in, though in vain as Strider had them stay in another
                room. They buy a pony from Bill Ferny. They pass through the
                Midgewater Marshes, and reach Weathertop. There they are
                attacked by five Black Riders; Frodo puts on the ring to escape
                them, and is stabbed in the shoulder by the Witch-king of
                Angmar, leader of the nine Ringwraiths (Nazgul).
              </dd>
              <dt>XII: Flight to the Ford:</dt>
              <dd>
                They pass the trolls Bert, Tom and William, which were turned to
                stone by Gandalf in The Hobbit. Eventually, they meet the elf
                Glorfindel from Rivendell, who allows Frodo to take his white
                horse to escape the Ringwraiths on their way to Rivendell. The
                Black Riders are washed away in a flood over the Ford.

              Book II chronicles Frodo's stay at Rivendell, where a plan is
              hatched at the Council of Elrond to destroy the Ring in Mordor.
              Early on Frodo meets his uncle Bilbo, whom he had not seen since
              he left Hobbiton much earlier. Frodo sets forth from Rivendell
              with nine companions:<em>
                two Men, Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of the land of
                Gondor; an Elven prince, Legolas; Frodo's old friend and
                powerful wizard, Gandalf; Gimli the Dwarf; and Frodo's original
                three hobbit companions</em
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>These Nine Walkers</strong> were chosen to represent the
              free races of Middle-earth and as a balance to the Nine Riders.
              They were also accompanied by Bill the Pony, whom Strider and the
              Hobbits acquired in Bree as a pack horse. Their attempt to cross
              the Misty Mountains is foiled by heavy snow, so they are forced to
              take a path under the mountains via Moria, an ancient Dwarf
              kingdom, now full of Orcs and other evil creatures, such as the
              Watcher in the Water guarding the south gate. Just before escaping
              Moria, Gandalf falls into the abyss while battling a Balrog.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>The remaining eight members of the Fellowship</em> then spend
              some time in the elf-haven of Lothl√≥rien, where they receive gifts
              from the Elf-queen Galadriel that in many cases prove useful later
              in the quest. They leave L√≥rien by river, but Frodo begins to
              realize the Ring is having a malevolent effect on some members of
              the party, especially Boromir, who tries to take the ring from
              Frodo. In the process, Frodo puts on the ring to escape him. Later
              Boromir is attacked by orcs while trying to defend Merry and
              Pippin. This book ends when Frodo and Sam depart secretly for
              Mordor and the Fellowship of the Ring dissolves.

                they notice Gollum following them down the river on a log; Orc
                Archers attack the boats; A Winged Nazg√ªl is seen flying above
                the Fellowship's boats, and is shot down by Legolas, who fires
                an arrow at the rider's flying beast; they reach the falls of
                Rauros, where they must choose between travelling on the east or
                west bank of the river to pass the falls.

                choice of whether to go east or west; Boromir tries to take the
                Ring from Frodo, who puts it on to escape him. The rest of the
                company splits up trying to find Frodo. Sam finds Frodo by the
                river and they cross it, thereby breaking up the Fellowship and
                continuing to Mount Doom on their own.

          <p>
            The Elves, who called themselves the Quendi, and who in lore are
            commonly referred to as the Eldar (adj. Eldarin), were the first and
            eldest of the Children of Il√∫vatar, and are considered to be the
            fairest and wisest of any race of Arda given sapience. Some, known
            afterwards as the Calaquendi (Elves of the Light), were brought by
            the Valar from Middle-earth to Valinor across the Sea, where they
            were taught by the Ainur. But after the Silmarils were stolen by
            Melkor, some of the Elves returned to Middle-earth, where they
            remained until the end of the Third Age. Elves were not subject to
            age, and were immune to illness. They could be killed only in
            violence or by extreme despair.

          <p>
            Orcs were the primary foot soldiers of the Dark Lords' armies and
            sometimes the weakest (but most numerous) of their servants. They
            were created by the first Dark Lord, Morgoth, before the First Age
            and served him and later his successor in their quest to dominate
            Middle-earth. Before Orom√´ first found the Elves at Cuivi√©nen,
            Melkor kidnapped some of them and cruelly tortured them, twisting
            them into the first Orcs.

          <h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Dwarves</h4>
          <p>
            Dwarves were a race of Middle-earth also known as the Khazad (in
            their own tongue) or Casari, Naugrim, meaning 'Stunted People', and
            Gonnhirrim, the 'Masters of Stone'.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dwarves were made by Aul√´, whom they themselves called Mahal,
            meaning ‚Äúmaker.‚Äù Aul√´ was unwilling to wait for the coming of the
            Children of Il√∫vatar, for he was impatient and desired to have
            someone to teach his lore and crafts. Therefore, he made the first
            Seven Fathers of the Dwarves in secret in a hall under the mountains
            of Middle-earth.
          </p>
          <img

            alt="Dwarves Mining"
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <p>
            It was, however, not within Aul√´'s power to create life. After being
            reprimanded by Il√∫vatar and realizing his error, Aul√´ offered his
            creations to his father to do with as he would, including their
            destruction. Even as the offer was made, Il√∫vatar accepted and gave
            the Dwarves a life of their own. So when Aul√´ picked up a great
            hammer to smite the Seven Fathers and destroy his presumptuous
            creations, they shrank back in fear and begged for mercy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Il√∫vatar was however not willing to suffer that the Dwarves should
            come before the Firstborn (Elves), and he decreed that the Seven
            Fathers should sleep underground and should not come forth until the
            Firstborn had awakened.

          <h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Men</h4>
          <p>
            Men (initially named Atani) were one of several races inhabiting
            Arda. They are the humans of Middle-earth, and the second of the
            Children of Il√∫vatar.
          </p>
          <p>
            he race of Men was the second significant race of beings created by
            the supreme God, Il√∫vatar, since they awoke at the start of the
            First Age, at the first rising of the Sun (FA 1), while the elves
            awoke three Ages before them. They were called the "Afterborn"
            (Quenya Atani, Sindarin: Edain) by the Elves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Men bear the Gift of Men, which is mortality, and therefore they age
            and die when their time comes, and are susceptible to illness and
            disease. Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not
            susceptible to aging and disease. Even if their bodies are slain,
            their spirits will remain bound to the world for as long as it
            lasts, and pass to the Halls of Mandos to wait until they are
            released or the world ends.

            <strong>Gondor</strong> was the most prominent kingdom of Men in
            Middle-earth, bordered by Rohan to the north, Harad to the south,
            the cape of Andrast and the Sea to the west, and Mordor to the east.
            Its first capital was Osgiliath, moved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640.
            The city of Minas Tirith remained the capital of Gondor for the rest
            of the Third Age and into years of the Fourth Age; other major
            fortresses included Dol Amroth in Belfalas and Osgiliath, which was
            a city on the Anduin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and An√°rion, exiles from
            N√∫menor. Gondor was an allied kingdom with Arnor, whose line of king
            chieftains came from Isildur, while the Line of the Kings of Gondor
            was from An√°rion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early
            years due to the ships and the military might that its armies
            possessed. However, continued attacks by allies of Sauron, civil
            war, and a devastating plague caused it to gradually decline over
            the course of the Third Age until Sauron's final defeat and the
            crowning of Aragorn II Elessar. Following that time the power of
            Gondor once again expanded, until the former lands of Arnor were
            brought under the banner of the Reunited Kingdom.
