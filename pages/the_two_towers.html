              Hobbits Merry and Pippin escape from the Orcs who captured them
              when the orcs themselves are attacked by the Riders of Rohan.
              Merry and Pippin head into nearby Fangorn Forest where they
              encounter treelike giants called Ents.
            </p>
            <p>
              The forest generally keep to themselves, but are moved to oppose
              the menace posed to the trees by the wizard Saruman, who has been
              chopping down trees in the forest to fuel fires for his furnaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf,</strong>
              tracking Merry and Pippin, come across the Riders of Rohan who
              tell them that they attacked the orcs the previous night and left
              no survivors. However, Strider is able to find small prints and
              they follow these into Fangorn, where they meet a white wizard who
              they at first believe to be Saruman, but who turns out to be their
              wizard friend Gandalf, whom they believed had perished in the
              mines of Moria.

              He tells them of his fall into the abyss, his battle to the death
              with the Balrog and his reawakening. The four ride to Edoras and
              persuade King Théoden that his people are in danger. In the
              process, Saruman's agent in Edoras, Grima Wormtongue, is expelled
              from the city. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas then travel to the
              defensive fortification Helm's Deep while Gandalf goes north in
              search of Erkenbrand's men to bring as reinforcements. At Helm's
              Deep, they resist an onslaught of Orcs and Men sent by Saruman,
              and Gandalf arrives the next morning with the Westfold army led by
              Erkenbrand just in time. The fleeing orcs run into a forest of
              Huorn half-tree, half-ent creatures and none escape. Aragorn,
              Gimli, Legolas, Gandalf and the Rohirric army then head to
              <em>Saruman's stronghold in Isengard</em>.

              There, they reunite with Merry and Pippin and find the city
              overrun by Ents, who have flooded it with the nearby river, and
              the central tower of Orthanc besieged, with Saruman in it. After
              giving <em>Saruman</em> a chance to repent, Gandalf casts him out
              of the order of wizards. Wormtongue throws something from a window
              at Gandalf and those with him. This turns out to be one of the
              palantíri. Pippin, unable to resist the urge, looks into it and
              has an encounter with Sauron. Gandalf and Pippin then head for
              Minas Tirith in preparation for the upcoming war. Chapters

                Aragorn finds Boromir hit with many arrows, who tells him that
                orcs took Merry and Pippin, and that they were still alive.
                Boromir dies, and his body is set down the stream on a 'funeral
                boat'; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to follow the orcs who
                had captured Merry and Pippin, rather than following Frodo and
                Sam. The three of them set off to chase the orcs.
              </dd>
              <dt>II: The Riders of Rohan:</dt>
              <dd>
                They follow the trail of the orcs and find several clues as to
                what happened with the hobbits, then meet a company of Rohirrim
                led by Éomer, who tell them that the orcs were destroyed and
                none were left alive. They camp near the site of the orc
                massacre.
              </dd>
              <dt>III: The Uruk-hai:</dt>

                This chapter begins further back in time, telling the story of
                Merry and Pippin being captured by the orcs, who are led by
                Ugluk from Saruman's army, and Grishnakh from Mordor. The two
                sides of orcs are constantly arguing. The orcs camp near Fangorn
                and Grishnakh attempts to take the hobbits away with him. The
                hobbits escape as Grishnakh is killed by an arrow. They flee
                into Fangorn Forest as the men of Rohan attack the orcs.

                <em>Merry and Pippin</em> meet Treebeard the Ent, who calls an
                Entmoot, a gathering of Ents in Derndingle. The hobbits meet
                another ent, Quickbeam. After three days of deliberation, the
                ents decide at the entmoot to attack Isengard.
              </dd>
              <dt>V: The White Rider:</dt>
              <dd>
                The chapter goes back to the story of Aragorn, Legolas and
                Gimli, who discover signs that the hobbits escaped the orcs into
                the forest. They meet an old man, who they at first presume to
                be Saruman, but who turns out to be <strong>Gandalf</strong>.
                They set off for Edoras.

              <dt>VIII: The Road to Isengard:</dt>
              <dd>
                They travel to Isengard, and see that it has been destroyed. At
                Isengard they find Merry and Pippin. IX - Flotsam and Jetsam -
                Merry and Pippin tell the story of how the ents attacked
                Isengard, in amongst the ruins or 'flotsam and jetsam' of the
                city.
              </dd>

              <dd>
                Saruman has a very persuasive voice, which he almost uses to
                persuade Theoden and the others until Gandalf casts him from the
                order of wizards. Wormtongue throws the Palantír of Orthanc from
                the tower, which misses Gandalf, and is picked up by Pippin.

            <p>
              <strong>Frodo</strong> and <strong>Sam</strong> discover Gollum
              stalking them as they try to reach Mount Doom to destroy the One
              Ring. Gollum hopes to reclaim the Ring. Sam loathes and distrusts
              him, but Frodo pities him. Gollum promises to lead them to a
              secret entrance to Mordor and for a time appears to be a true
              ally.
            </p>
            <p>
              They first stop at the<strong> Black gate of Mordor</strong>,
              where Gollum persuades them not to go in, where they would surely
              have been caught. They head south into Ithilien, and are captured
              by Faramir, the brother of Boromir. Faramir learns from Frodo of
              his brother's death and the plan to destroy the ring, and
              eventually allows them to go on their way. Gollum leads them into
              the lair of Shelob, an enormous spider-like creature, who inflicts
              her poisonous bite on Frodo. Sam resolves to finish the quest
              himself and takes the Ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, when Orcs take Frodo's body, he follows them and learns
              that Frodo is not dead but unconscious and now their prisoner. The
              last line of the book is "Frodo was alive but taken by the enemy."

            sent to Middle-earth while embodied as old Men to aid the Free
            Peoples against the threat of Sauron.
          </p>
          <p>
            he Wizards were known by various names and were arrayed in different
            colors. Of those who came to Middle-earth, sent by the Valar, five
            are known, the Heren Istarion (Order of Wizards). After arriving in
            Middle-earth, the two Blue Wizards apparently went east before the
            War of the Ring; whether they played a part in the events of that
            war is unknown. (Note: According to Tolkien's letters they may have
            formed cults for magic worship and practice among the Easterlings.)
            Radagast the Brown concerned himself mainly with plants and animals,
            living in Mirkwood for many years. Saruman the White, and Gandalf
            the Grey spent their time with the Free Peoples: the Elves, Dwarves,
            and Men. Saruman was wise and respected, later becoming the head of
            the White Council in TA 2463. However, he became prideful and
            jealous of the power and purity of Gandalf's spirit and reputation.
            Saruman slowly came to betray the original purpose of the Wizards
            and sought power for himself.

            At the end of the Third Age, the Wizards passed from sight because
            with the fall of Sauron their work was done. Gandalf passed over the
            Sea with the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings. Radagast
            remained in Middle-earth, tending to the wilderness. During the War
            of the ring, Saruman was overthrown, banished from Istari Order by
            Gandalf, killed by a servant after a failed attempt to rule the
            Shire, and even his Maiar spirit was barred from ever returning to
            Aman due to his betrayal of Manwë and the original purpose of the
            Wizards. The fate of the Blue Wizards is unknown.

            Hobbits, also known as Halflings, were an ancient mortal race that
            lived in Middle-earth. Although their exact origins are unknown,
            they were initially found in the northern regions of Middle-earth
            and below the Vales of Anduin. At the beginning of the Third Age,
            hobbits moved north and west. Most of their race eventually founded
            the land of the Shire in about the year TA 1601, though one type of
            hobbit known as Stoors remained in the Anduin Vale (the type of
            hobbit Sméagol was).

          <p>
            Ents, also known as Onodrim (Tree-host) by the Elves, were a very
            old race of Middle-earth. They were apparently created at the behest
            of Yavanna after she learned of Aulë's children, the dwarves,
            knowing that they would want to fell trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Considered "shepherds" of the trees, they protected certain forests
            from orcs and other perils. The Elves had tales of teaching the
            trees and the Ents to talk: although the Ents were sentient beings
            at the time, they did not know how to speak until the Elves taught
            them. Treebeard spoke of the Elves "curing the Ents of their
            dumbness", an unforgettable gift.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ents are tree-like creatures, becoming gradually more and more like
            the trees they herded. They varied in height, size, colouring, and
            number of fingers and toes. An individual Ent usually resembled the
            species of tree they guarded. For example, Quickbeam guarded rowan
            trees, and looked very much like those trees (tall and slender,
            etc.). Ents were very strong, as recounted by Merry and Pippin:
            "Their punches can crumple iron like tin, and they can tear apart
            solid rock like breadcrusts." In the Third Age, the forest of
            Fangorn was supposedly the last remaining residence of Ents, though
            huorns still dwelt in other places such as the Old Forest.

          <h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Trolls</h4>
          <p>
            Trolls were a very large and monstrous, and for the most part
            unintelligent, humanoid race inhabiting Middle-earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Torog was the Elven (Sindarin) name for those of troll-kind. Tolkien
            normally renders it as "troll" in his works. The derivation of this
            word is uncertain - it may be derived from old Elvish words or
            perhaps imitates olog, which seems to be the comparative term in
            Black Speech.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the War of the Ring, Frodo and the Fellowship encountered
            cave trolls alongside various orcs within Moria. Boromir's sword
            recoiled off the scaled hide of one troll. As things seemed
            perilous, however, the trolls fled (although this was due to the
            approach of the balrog, Durin's Bane). Sauron used Olog-hai in the
            Siege of Gondor and Battle of the Pelennor Fields. In the subsequent
            Battle at the Black Gate, the hobbit Peregrin Took killed a large
            Olog-hai troll with his barrow-blade. As a result of the One Ring
            being destroyed, the Black Gate collapsed into ruin during that
            battle. Most of the trolls present at the battle were killed, and
            the others are known to have fled.

          <h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Uruk-Hai</h4>
          <p>
            The Uruks first appeared out of Mordor, in TA 2475, when they
            assaulted and managed to conquer Ithilien and destroyed the city of
            Osgiliath. The Uruks in the service of Barad-dûr used the symbol of
            the red Eye of Sauron, which was also painted on their shields.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uruk-hai were later bred by the Wizard Saruman the White late in the
            Third Age, by his dark arts in the pits of Isengard. In the War of
            the Ring, the Uruk-hai made up a large part of Saruman's army,
            together with the Dunlendings, man-enemies of Rohan. There are
            suggestions that the Uruk-hai were the result of crossbreeding orcs
            and men. There were other creatures in Saruman's armies, and under
            his command in the Shire, that appear to have been hybrids.
            "Half-orcs" were as tall as Men and are never described simply as
            orcs, as the Uruk-hai frequently are. Saruman's vast army of
            Uruk-hai fought against King Théoden of Rohan and his people at the
            Helm's Deep.
