					<p>Hobbits Merry and Pippin escape from the Orcs who captured them when the orcs themselves are attacked by the Riders of Rohan. Merry and Pippin head into nearby Fangorn Forest where they encounter treelike giants called Ents.
</p>
	
	<p>The forest generally keep to themselves, but are moved to oppose the menace posed to the trees by the wizard Saruman, who has been chopping down trees in the forest to fuel fires for his furnaces.
</p>
	
	<p><strong>Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf,</strong> tracking Merry and Pippin, come across the Riders of Rohan who tell them that they attacked the orcs the previous night and left no survivors. However, Strider is able to find small prints and they follow these into Fangorn, where they meet a white wizard who they at first believe to be Saruman, but who turns out to be their wizard friend Gandalf, whom they believed had perished in the mines of Moria.</p>

	<p> He tells them of his fall into the abyss, his battle to the death with the Balrog and his reawakening. The four ride to Edoras and persuade King Théoden that his people are in danger. In the process, Saruman's agent in Edoras, Grima Wormtongue, is expelled from the city. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas then travel to the defensive fortification Helm's Deep while Gandalf goes north in search of Erkenbrand's men to bring as reinforcements. At Helm's Deep, they resist an onslaught of Orcs and Men sent by Saruman, and Gandalf arrives the next morning with the Westfold army led by Erkenbrand just in time. The fleeing orcs run into a forest of Huorn half-tree, half-ent creatures and none escape. Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Gandalf and the Rohirric army then head to <em>Saruman's stronghold in Isengard</em>.</p>

	<p>
There, they reunite with Merry and Pippin and find the city overrun by Ents, who have flooded it with the nearby river, and the central tower of Orthanc besieged, with Saruman in it. After giving <em>Saruman</em> a chance to repent, Gandalf casts him out of the order of wizards. Wormtongue throws something from a window at Gandalf and those with him. This turns out to be one of the palantíri. Pippin, unable to resist the urge, looks into it and has an encounter with Sauron. Gandalf and Pippin then head for Minas Tirith in preparation for the upcoming war.
Chapters</p>
	
	<h3>Chapters:</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>I: The Departure of Boromir:</dt> 
		<dd> Aragorn finds Boromir hit with many arrows, who tells him that orcs took Merry and Pippin, and that they were still alive. Boromir dies, and his body is set down the stream on a 'funeral boat'; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to follow the orcs who had captured Merry and Pippin, rather than following Frodo and Sam. The three of them set off to chase the orcs.</dd>
    <dt>II: The Riders of Rohan:</dt> 
		<dd>They follow the trail of the orcs and find several clues as to what happened with the hobbits, then meet a company of Rohirrim led by Éomer, who tell them that the orcs were destroyed and none were left alive. They camp near the site of the orc massacre.</dd>
    <dt>III: The Uruk-hai:</dt>
		<dd> This chapter begins further back in time, telling the story of Merry and Pippin being captured by the orcs, who are led by Ugluk from Saruman's army, and Grishnakh from Mordor. The two sides of orcs are constantly arguing. The orcs camp near Fangorn and Grishnakh attempts to take the hobbits away with him. The hobbits escape as Grishnakh is killed by an arrow. They flee into Fangorn Forest as the men of Rohan attack the orcs.</dd>
    <dt>IV: Treebeard:</dt>
		<dd><em>Merry and Pippin</em> meet Treebeard the Ent, who calls an Entmoot, a gathering of Ents in Derndingle. The hobbits meet another ent, Quickbeam. After three days of deliberation, the ents decide at the entmoot to attack Isengard.</dd>
    <dt>V: The White Rider:</dt> 
		<dd>The chapter goes back to the story of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, who discover signs that the hobbits escaped the orcs into the forest. They meet an old man, who they at first presume to be Saruman, but who turns out to be <strong>Gandalf</strong>. They set off for Edoras.</dd>
    <dt>VI: The King of the Golden Hall:</dt> 
		<dd>The four of them reach Edoras and talk with King Theoden. Wormtongue is thrown out of the city. Theoden gives Gandalf the horse Shadowfax.</dd>
    <dt>VII: Helm's Deep:</dt>
		<dd>Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are at Helm's Deep with the Rohan army, defending the people of Rohan from attack by the army of Saruman.</dd>
    <dt>VIII: The Road to Isengard:</dt> 
		<dd>They travel to Isengard, and see that it has been destroyed. At Isengard they find Merry and Pippin.
    IX - Flotsam and Jetsam - Merry and Pippin tell the story of how the ents attacked Isengard, in amongst the ruins or 'flotsam and jetsam' of the city.</dd>
    <dt>X: The Voice of Saruman:</dt>
		<dd> Saruman has a very persuasive voice, which he almost uses to persuade Theoden and the others until Gandalf casts him from the order of wizards. Wormtongue throws the Palantír of Orthanc from the tower, which misses Gandalf, and is picked up by Pippin.</dd>
    <dt>XI: The Palantir:</dt>
		<dd> Pippin picks up the Palantír and is seen by Sauron. Gandalf explains the origin of the Palantír; Gandalf sets off with Pippin for Minas Tirith, riding on Shadowfax.</dd>

			<h2 id="Book4"><i class="fas fa-scroll"></i> Book IV: The Journey of the Ringbearers / The Ring Goes East</h2>
			<p><strong>Frodo</strong> and <strong>Sam</strong> discover Gollum stalking them as they try to reach Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Gollum hopes to reclaim the Ring. Sam loathes and distrusts him, but Frodo pities him. Gollum promises to lead them to a secret entrance to Mordor and for a time appears to be a true ally.</p>
		
		<p>They first stop at the<strong> Black gate of Mordor</strong>, where Gollum persuades them not to go in, where they would surely have been caught. They head south into Ithilien, and are captured by Faramir, the brother of Boromir. Faramir learns from Frodo of his brother's death and the plan to destroy the ring, and eventually allows them to go on their way. Gollum leads them into the lair of Shelob, an enormous spider-like creature, who inflicts her poisonous bite on Frodo. Sam resolves to finish the quest himself and takes the Ring.</p>
		
		<p> However, when Orcs take Frodo's body, he follows them and learns that Frodo is not dead but unconscious and now their prisoner. The last line of the book is "Frodo was alive but taken by the enemy."</p>

			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Wizards</h4>
			
			<p>The Wizards, initially known as the Istari, were five Maiar spirits sent to Middle-earth while embodied as old Men to aid the Free Peoples against the threat of Sauron. </p>
			<p>he Wizards were known by various names and were arrayed in different colors. Of those who came to Middle-earth, sent by the Valar, five are known, the Heren Istarion (Order of Wizards). After arriving in Middle-earth, the two Blue Wizards apparently went east before the War of the Ring; whether they played a part in the events of that war is unknown. (Note: According to Tolkien's letters they may have formed cults for magic worship and practice among the Easterlings.) Radagast the Brown concerned himself mainly with plants and animals, living in Mirkwood for many years. Saruman the White, and Gandalf the Grey spent their time with the Free Peoples: the Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Saruman was wise and respected, later becoming the head of the White Council in TA 2463. However, he became prideful and jealous of the power and purity of Gandalf's spirit and reputation. Saruman slowly came to betray the original purpose of the Wizards and sought power for himself. </p>
		    <img src="../images/wizards.jpg" class="sidebar_image" title="The Five Wizards,from left to right:Pallando,Radagast,Saruman,Gandalf the Grey,Alatar" alt="The Five Wizards">
			<p>At the end of the Third Age, the Wizards passed from sight because with the fall of Sauron their work was done. Gandalf passed over the Sea with the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings. Radagast remained in Middle-earth, tending to the wilderness. During the War of the ring, Saruman was overthrown, banished from Istari Order by Gandalf, killed by a servant after a failed attempt to rule the Shire, and even his Maiar spirit was barred from ever returning to Aman due to his betrayal of Manwë and the original purpose of the Wizards. The fate of the Blue Wizards is unknown. </p>

			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Hobbits</h4>
			
				<img src="../images/hobbits.jpg" class="sidebar_image" title="Frodo and his companions leaving The Shire" alt="Frodo and his companions leaving The Shire">
            <p>Hobbits, also known as Halflings, were an ancient mortal race that lived in Middle-earth. Although their exact origins are unknown, they were initially found in the northern regions of Middle-earth and below the Vales of Anduin. At the beginning of the Third Age, hobbits moved north and west. Most of their race eventually founded the land of the Shire in about the year TA 1601, though one type of hobbit known as Stoors remained in the Anduin Vale (the type of hobbit Sméagol was). </p>

			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Ents</h4>
			<img src="../images/ents.jpg" class="sidebar_image" title="Ents" alt="Ents">
				<p>Ents, also known as Onodrim (Tree-host) by the Elves, were a very old race of Middle-earth. They were apparently created at the behest of Yavanna after she learned of Aulë's children, the dwarves, knowing that they would want to fell trees. </p>
			<p>Considered "shepherds" of the trees, they protected certain forests from orcs and other perils. The Elves had tales of teaching the trees and the Ents to talk: although the Ents were sentient beings at the time, they did not know how to speak until the Elves taught them. Treebeard spoke of the Elves "curing the Ents of their dumbness", an unforgettable gift. </p>
			
			<p>Ents are tree-like creatures, becoming gradually more and more like the trees they herded. They varied in height, size, colouring, and number of fingers and toes. An individual Ent usually resembled the species of tree they guarded. For example, Quickbeam guarded rowan trees, and looked very much like those trees (tall and slender, etc.). Ents were very strong, as recounted by Merry and Pippin: "Their punches can crumple iron like tin, and they can tear apart solid rock like breadcrusts." In the Third Age, the forest of Fangorn was supposedly the last remaining residence of Ents, though huorns still dwelt in other places such as the Old Forest. </p>

			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Trolls</h4>
           <p>Trolls were a very large and monstrous, and for the most part unintelligent, humanoid race inhabiting Middle-earth. </p>
			<p>Torog was the Elven (Sindarin) name for those of troll-kind. Tolkien normally renders it as "troll" in his works. The derivation of this word is uncertain - it may be derived from old Elvish words or perhaps imitates olog, which seems to be the comparative term in Black Speech. </p>
			<p>During the War of the Ring, Frodo and the Fellowship encountered cave trolls alongside various orcs within Moria. Boromir's sword recoiled off the scaled hide of one troll. As things seemed perilous, however, the trolls fled (although this was due to the approach of the balrog, Durin's Bane). Sauron used Olog-hai in the Siege of Gondor and Battle of the Pelennor Fields. In the subsequent Battle at the Black Gate, the hobbit Peregrin Took killed a large Olog-hai troll with his barrow-blade. As a result of the One Ring being destroyed, the Black Gate collapsed into ruin during that battle. Most of the trolls present at the battle were killed, and the others are known to have fled. </p>

		<article class="sidebararticle">
		<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Uruk-Hai</h4>
		
		
		
		<p>The Uruks first appeared out of Mordor, in TA 2475, when they assaulted and managed to conquer Ithilien and destroyed the city of Osgiliath. The Uruks in the service of Barad-dûr used the symbol of the red Eye of Sauron, which was also painted on their shields. </p>
			<p>Uruk-hai were later bred by the Wizard Saruman the White late in the Third Age, by his dark arts in the pits of Isengard. In the War of the Ring, the Uruk-hai made up a large part of Saruman's army, together with the Dunlendings, man-enemies of Rohan. There are suggestions that the Uruk-hai were the result of crossbreeding orcs and men. There were other creatures in Saruman's armies, and under his command in the Shire, that appear to have been hybrids. "Half-orcs" were as tall as Men and are never described simply as orcs, as the Uruk-hai frequently are. Saruman's vast army of Uruk-hai fought against King Théoden of Rohan and his people at the Helm's Deep. </p>
