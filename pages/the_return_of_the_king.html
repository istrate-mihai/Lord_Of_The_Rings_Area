		<p>	<img id="return_cover" src="../images/return_cover.jpg" title="Book Cover" alt="Book Cover"> The story begins as<strong> Gandalf</strong> delivers news to<strong> Denethor</strong>, the steward of Gondor, that war is imminent. Gandalf brings Pippin with him, who enters the service of the steward. Aragorn, by his courage and leadership, proves himself a worthy ruler of men. He is destined to find a lost army of men now dead yet entrapped in a curse set forth long ago by their own disobedience, in the place known as the Paths of the Dead.</p>
		<p>The remnants of the Fellowship lead the forces of Gondor and Rohan in defence of Gondor's capital city, Minas Tirith, resulting in the cataclysmic Battle of the <em>Pelennor Fields</em>. Those characters who manage to survive the battle are led by Aragorn on an assuredly suicidal feint-attack against the Black Gates of Mordor, partly to distract Sauron from defending his other borders so that Frodo and Sam can gain a clear passage into Mordor. Aragorn's company now surrounds the Black Gates of the Morannon exchanging idle words with the Mouth of Sauron.

			<p>In the meanwhile, the brave and loyal Sam Gamgee (who for a short time had himself become the ring-bearer) enables the <strong>long-suffering Frodo Baggins</strong> to navigate the barren wasteland of Mordor. For part of the way, they are captured by a company of Orcs and must pretend to be orcs before they are able to escape.</p>
		<p>The company, tired and half-alive, finally reaches the Crack of Doom, where the One Ring is destroyed along with Gollum, freeing Middle-earth from Sauron's power forever. This happens when Frodo at the last moment decides to keep the ring rather than destroy it, and is attacked by <strong>Gollum</strong> who bites off Frodo's finger to take the ring, trips, and falls into the lava while still holding the ring. Frodo and Sam are rescued by the giant eagles whom Gandalf rides to Mount Doom, from the black gates of Morannon.</p>
		<p>After Sauron is defeated, his armies at the black gates flee, and the men of Gondor and Rohan are victorious in the battle.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor</strong> at Minas Tirith. After a series of goodbyes, the Hobbits return home, only to find the Shire under the control of 'Sharkey' who they find out is Saruman, diminished in power but not in malevolence. Merry and Pippin, now experienced warriors of Rohan and Gondor respectively, take the lead in setting things right again, and lead an uprising of hobbits against Saruman, freeing the shire. Time passes.</p>
		<p>The Shire heals, but Frodo does not. Eventually Frodo departs for the Undying Lands to find healing, along with Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the Elves. Sam, Merry and Pippin watch them depart and return home in silence. Sam is greeted by his wife Rose and his daughter Elanor. In the last line of the book Sam says to Rose; "Well, I'm back".</p>

			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Sauron</h4>
			  <img src="../images/sauron.jpg" class="sidebar_image" title="Sauron" alt="Sauron">
			<p>Sauron (Q.: IPA [ˈsaʊron] or [ˈθaʊron]); "The Abhorred"), or the eponymous Lord of the Rings, was a fallen Maia, creator of the One Ring, a gifted student of Vala Aulë the Smith and lieutenant of Melkor (Morgoth). After his master's defeat by the Valar, Sauron became the second Dark Lord and sought to conquer Arda by creating the Rings of Power. </p>
		
			<p>In the Second Age, he was defeated in the War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men united under kings Gil-galad and Elendil. In the final battle, Isildur managed to cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger, dismantling the Dark Lord's corporeal form and power. After centuries lying dormant, rebuilding his strength, Sauron returned to power late in the Third Age, but was permanently crippled in the War of the Ring after destruction of the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom by a hobbit Frodo Baggins. </p>
			<p>Sauron was also called Gorthaur the Cruel by the Elves of Beleriand in the First Age. </p>

			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Morgoth</h4>
			
				<img src="../images/morgoth.jpg" class="sidebar_image" title="Morgoth" alt="Morgoth">
           <p>Melkor (Quenya; IPA: "He who arises in might"), later known predominantly as Morgoth (Sindarin; IPA: "Black Foe of the World"),[1] was the first Dark Lord, and the primordial source of evil in Eä. </p>
			<p>Originally the most powerful of the Ainur created by Eru Ilúvatar, Melkor rebelled against his creator out of pride and sought to corrupt Arda. After committing many evils in the First Age, such as the theft of the Silmarils, which resulted in his name Morgoth, and the destruction of the Two Lamps and the Two Trees of Valinor, Morgoth was defeated by the Host of Valinor in the War of Wrath. As punishment he was cast out of Arda into the Void, though it was prophesied he would one day return. </p>

			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Shelob</h4>
			<img src="../images/shelob.jpg" class="sidebar_image" title="Shelob" alt="Shelob">
				<p>Shelob was a great Spider and the greatest offspring of Ungoliant, the primordial spider. In the Third Age she lived in Mordor and was known to feed indiscriminately, preying on the inhabitants. She was encountered by Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in their quest to destroy the One Ring. </p>

			<h4><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Dragons</h4>
          <p>Dragons were ancient, intelligent, powerful creatures, as feared as they were admired in Middle-earth. Their exact origin is debated, though it was clearly stated that they were created by Morgoth in some sense, millennia before the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. </p>
